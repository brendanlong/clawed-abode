- Always use types and avoid the 'any' type
- Always validate inputs using libraries like Zod
- Always factor out shared logic
- Don't maintain backwards compatbility, always delete code we're not using
- Read the design doc and keep it up-to-date @doc/DESIGN.md and @doc/architecture.d2
- Avoid N+1 queries, and check-then-set patterns; prefer to do joins or inserts with on conflict
- Design as much code as possible to be unit-testable with pure functions
- Prefer to use real versions of necessary systems for integration tests (i.e. actually run git in a tmp dir, actually run SQLite on an in-memory DB)
- Co-locate test files with source (e.g., `auth.ts` → `auth.test.ts`, or `git.ts` → `git.integration.test.ts` for integration tests)
- Run `pnpm test:run` to verify tests pass before committing
- Try to do work in commit-sized chunks and commit when each piece is complete
- Always commit changes when work is complete
- Always use cursor-based pagination and never offset
- Use pnpm instead of npm
- Always use shadcn/ui components
- Use the centralized logger (`createLogger` from `@/lib/logger`) for all backend logging, especially errors
- When writing test, don't mock components where the real version is easy to run (like SQLite in-memory)
- Always write tests for the intended behavior of functions, not the actual behavior. If the actual behavior is wrong and the issue is pre-existing, write the test correctly, mark it skipped, and file a GitHub issue on brendanlong/clawed-abode
